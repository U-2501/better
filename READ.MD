# WebView Lab

**WebView Lab** is a deployable, webview-style proxy runtime designed for
learning, research, and comparison with browser emulators and embedded
web engines (e.g. Android WebView, Electron).

It works by fetching upstream websites, rewriting navigation and assets,
and rendering them inside a controlled webview shell.

> This project is intended for **educational and research purposes**.
> It does not attempt to bypass security systems or anti-bot protections.
